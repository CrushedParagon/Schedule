----------
Using the jar files
----------

This program comes with 2 .jar files, AutomaticSchedule.jar and ViewSchedule.jar

AutomaticSchedule brings up the creator, which allows you to add classes. To use this enter the class name in the appropriate text field, and the start and end times in the format hh:mm.

Example: Name: STAT 1400
	 Start Time: 12:45
	 End time: 14:30

After entering this information click "Add" to add the class to that day.

Clicking reset will remove all classes for that one specific day, while leaving the others undamaged

Clicking save will create the txt files in the img folder, overriting any files that were there before

Clicking View Schedule will launch the program with the current .txt files.


The ViewSchedule .jar file will show the schedule without launching the creator

How to Run
-------
Download the .jar files from the github page.
While not required, puttting it in its own directory is a good idea to better keep track of the generated .png files and the img directory
